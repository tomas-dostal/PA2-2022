## Copying

I strongly discourage you from copying the code from the repository. 
If you are looking for inspiration, take a look [here](https://github.com/JahodaPaul/FIT_CTU)). There is nothing really to copy. In case you deside to do so, it might help you at the moment, but in the long-term, it will just harm you. Most of the courses @ [Progtest](https://progtest.fit.cvut.cz) have an anti-cheating mechanism, be aware. It might not be easy, but you are here to acquire knowledge and if you'd wanted it by the easy way, you wouldn't have chosen [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).
