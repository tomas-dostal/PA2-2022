In this repo, you can find my solutions for [Progtest](https://progtest.fit.cvut.cz) tasks assigned in B202 and B212 (some of them are identical). The repo is published in the hope it might help someone.

## Copying


I strongly discourage you from copying the code from the repository (If you are looking for inspiration, take a look [here](https://github.com/JahodaPaul/FIT_CTU)). TBH there is nothing really to copy. Anyway... It might help you at the moment, but in the long-term, it will just harm you. Most of the courses @ [Progtest](https://progtest.fit.cvut.cz) have an anti-cheating mechanism, be aware. It might not be easy, but you are here to acquire knowledge and if you'd wanted it by the easy way, you wouldn't have chosen [FIT CTU](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).
